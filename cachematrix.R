# Peer Graded Assignment: Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping

## This code is my solution to second assignments from the R programming on Coursera.

## It's better to cache the results when we running time consuming computations 
## instead of calculate it agian.

## According to the course in Coursera and content in week 3 we see the computing matrix is costly, 
## so we can compute it and then cache the inverse of matrix. 

## So, our first function as in templete is called "makeCacheMatrix" that we'll  
## creates a  “matrix” object and thencache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
